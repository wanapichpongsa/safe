# **Pearson is in trouble**
<br />
### **Introduction**
Education is about to be flipped on its head. First disrupted by video sharing on the internet –i.e., Youtube–, where individual creators surpassed businesses, AI is now rewriting the competitive rulebook.
<br />
Large Language Models (LLM) embody what Web 3.0 idealises as a ‘semantic search engine’, personalising search queries with human-like reasoning at scale. AI’s ability to instantly adapt to individual learning nuances on a global scale is reducing demand for static educational content – threatening traditional education giants (Milliot, 2024).
<br />
No giant has fully recovered when a newcomer monopolises the market with revolutionary technology. SAFE challenges the aforementioned status quo by deploying solutions with startup-like growth for enterprises. Through comparative assessments –see Appendix A– of relevancy, willingness, and transparency, Pearson emerged as the company of choice.
<br />
### **Company Overview**
	Pearson had a strong financial performance in 2023, with 5% annual growth in sales revenue amounting to £3.674B, driven products and services in 3 main markets: Assessment & Qualifications (55%), Book Publishing (35%) and Remote Education (10%) (Being and Investments, 2021). For the coming years, Pearson continues to prioritise their primary Key Performance Indicator of customer satisfaction, with emphasis on digital users (Pearson, 2023, p. 13). However, Pearson VUE and Pearson PTE –both in Assessment & Qualifications– show limited growth potential, leaving Pearson+ as its best hope for success.
<br />
Although Assessment & Qualifications –worth £1.59 billion– generates significant free cash flow –33% US and 28.6% UK market share–, Pearson’s position in this market is being diluted (Being and Investments, 2021). According to a 2024 report by UK Regulator OfQual, the number of certifiers reached 251 in 2023, with AQA (38.7%) being the market leader followed by Pearson (28.6%), OCR (23.5%) and WJEC (9.2%). With the number of certifiers growing by a CAGR of 12.3% for the past 5 years, saturation in the UK’s Assessment & Qualifications market threatens Pearson’s stake in the market (OfQual, 2024). This case of saturation is especially worse in a market like Assessment & Qualifications, where competitors are offering products that are almost homogenous, as the assessments themselves do not offer as much differentiation to the customer as distributors market them to be. Regulation was previously a barrier to entry that allowed for an oligarchical market structure. With regulation being lax, Assessment & Qualifications is arguably transforming into a monopolistic competition –similar products– market. Despite theoretic forecasts being cynical for Pearson, competitive pricing, accrued prestige and bundling of products exclusive to companies large enough to benefit off economies of scale still matter to customers. This gives Pearson a significant chance of retaining similar market power in the future. Nevertheless, potential for growth in Assessment & Qualifications is limited and risk of dilution can only be mitigated through traditional business tactics, thus should not be the focus for digital innovation.
<br />
	Pearson is the market leader of Educational Publishing in the United States (40%) and is competing against Cengage (24%) and McGrawHill (21%). Growth in this market is stunted by piracy (21%) and second-hand distribution (42%) (Being Investments, 2021). When comparing the ebook piracy issue to the music piracy issue in 2009 –Sony vs. Pirate Bay–, preventing piracy is practically impossible. To have a place in the future of education, Pearson must focus on packaging an irreplaceable personalised learning experience.
<br />
### **Consumer Trends & Opportunity**
	The real threat and opportunity lies in the ‘Blue Ocean’ education market that consists of buyers that seek dynamic content over static content. Dynamism has always been a unique selling point of educational services, but matters more pertinently because of the abnormal rate of information exchange made possible by the internet.
<br />
This market is characterised as a new –and undefined– online education market, with Coursera, Udemy and Codecademy representing the early prototypes of dynamic learning systems. Having popular university professors teach ‘high demand’ skills on cloud, who’s content is then organised by an AI recommender system, not only appeals to vocational students –inclusive of K-12– who are tired of an outdated curriculum, but also drastically decouples the customer value chain for education. Undergraduate and postgraduate certifications can be obtained straight from the internet, at a fraction of the cost to then be used as a credential for employment. While not a close enough substitute for highschool and university degrees yet, it is clear that the education renaissance has begun. When it’ll drastically transform the hierarchy of education giants – is unpredictable.
<br />
Pearson+ has exceeded 1 million paid subscriptions in 2023, and has potential of being the dynamic learning system that is omnipresent in global education. Breaking the product apart, Pearson not only coupled A level content and vocational content, but also included a differentiating feature that matches users to real-time job openings using an AI recommender system.

### **Criticism**
The mind map produced by Mapify provides a broad overview but lacks depth in key areas, particularly regarding Pearson’s strategic advantages and industry-specific challenges.
<br />
Firstly, the map misses a critical discussion on Pearson’s AI tool, an innovative feature that offers a competitive edge. This omission weakens the map’s effectiveness in showcasing Pearson’s commitment to cutting-edge technology. Additionally, Pearson’s market leadership and digital-first strategy over the past five years should be emphasised, as this has enabled the company to quickly adapt to digital trends, unlike many competitors.
<br />
While the Changing Consumer Expectations (in green) section mentions a demand for flexibility, it overlooks personalisation, which is increasingly expected by modern learners. Highlighting Pearson’s adaptive platforms like MyLab and Mastering would underscore its dedication to delivering customised learning experiences. Expanding on how Pearson empowers educators with analytics to personalise teaching could reinforce the focus on a user-centric approach, crucial in today’s digital education landscape.
<br />
The map could also be improved by adding sections on regulatory and compliance challenges. Pearson’s adherence to data privacy regulations like GDPR and COPPA, for example, reflects its commitment to ethical practices—vital for user trust in digital education. Similarly, accessibility and digital literacy are omitted but are essential for inclusive education. Pearson’s efforts in these areas should be highlighted to show its proactive stance on inclusivity and accessibility for diverse learner needs.
<br />
Furthermore, the mind map lacks a discussion of bite-sized and modular content, which aligns with current trends in digital learning. Emphasising this shift, along with self-paced learning, micro-credentials, and competency-based assessments, would present a more comprehensive view of evolving delivery models. Finally, mentioning learning analytics and real-time adaptive assessments would showcase the industry’s commitment to data-driven, impactful teaching strategies.
<br />
While the map outlines basic industry elements, it needs a sharper focus on Pearson’s unique strengths and more detail on personalisation, compliance, inclusivity, modular learning, and data-driven insights to reflect the current landscape of digital education more accurately.
